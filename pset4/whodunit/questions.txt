1.  stdint.h is a header file that allows programmers to reference specific bit sized (width) integers, for the purpose of having fine tuned control over variable size.
2.  Sometimes you need a very specific variable size for an array or offset, so using those fixed size integer derivatives allows more fine tuned control over your code.
3.  BYTE: 1, DWORD: 4, LONG: 4,WORD: 2
4.  0x42 0x4D (BM)
5.  bfSize is contained within the BITMAPFILEHEADER (size of BMP file in bytes) whereas biSize is contained within the BITMAPINFOHEADER (size of the header)
6.  If the biHeight is negative, it means the image is stored upsidedown (first pixel data is last in the file sequence).
7.  biBitCount represents bits per pixel
8.  It might return null if the file does not exist
9.  In the copy.c code, in each instance it is only reading one block of t_size "size", but the size changes each time.
10. The padding should end up being 3. (4 - (9 % 4)) % 4 = 3
11. fseek sets an offset in the filestream object so that we can read from a specific byte (as specified)
12. SEEK_CUR appears to represent the current position.
